- **Level 2**: "Metroidvania" style level set in a hollowed-out asteroid. This level features branching paths, tight jumps, and exploration opportunities. It's a perfect place to test the main character's abilities in varied environments.

- **Level 3**: Okay we've got ourselves a top down space themed game where you hunt down and eliminate the enemy. I've implemented an enemy with AI that will seek to destroy you, an auto targeting laser system, a collectable dropped by killed enemies, and variable power and enemy hp based on number of collected items.


(Note: More levels will be detailed as development progresses.)
